              <p>"Not only can [Daniel] work independently, I never had to worry when a task was handed to him because I was confident and constantly reassured that <b>he would not only complete the task in a timely manner, but would most often go above and beyond expectations</b>."</p>

              <p>"Daniel demonstrated his can-do attitude and always met deadlines while having an attention to detail. The most valuable feature he exhibited is that <b>he can balance and prioritize multi-layered tasks</b>.

              I’m impressed by this outstanding young man and believe he will be an asset in any organization."</p>

            <li>
              <p>"Daniel was a great tutor! I am so glad that we had him tutoring my daughter on Java programming this summer. His command of the programming language was fantastic. His ability to translate that knowledge into terms [so that] someone totally new to programming could grasp and learn was outstanding. Daniel was well organized and well prepared for each tutoring session. He even helped with preparing [for my daughter's] final exam by providing practice questions and quizzes. <b>Daniel seemed to have a genuine interest in my daughter’s success.</b> I think very highly of him and would recommend tutoring from him to anyone who needs help."</p>
